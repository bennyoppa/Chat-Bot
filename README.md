COMP9900 project

Download Data_Collector_Package folder on Windows machines, and run main.exe file in Data_Collector_Package\dist\main folder, 
this will not require any library installation and will work on any Windows machine without Python, and environment setup is not required. 
Main.exe can be used for setting up automatic update service.
This code is implemented and tested on Window 10 machine. In case the code is needed to be run,
install python 3.6, and pip install beautifulsoup4
Once this is done set the path environment variable to C:\Python36\Scripts. 
And in any python integrated development environment (IDE) run the seven code files like Course_time.py, etc. 
In case you want to package the code, it will require pyinstaller package on computer and then run main.py.
